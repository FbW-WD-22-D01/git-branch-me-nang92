# Branch Out

**Instructions**
* Create a new repository locally. 
* Add a readme file to the main branch. Add a heading to file. Make sure to add, commit your changes. 
* Create a branch named `content` and switch to the new branch.
* Add text to the readme file on the `content` branch. Don't forget to add and commit these changes.
* Go back to main and create another branch named `hotfix` from main. Note that the changes in your previous branch, `content`, are not there. 
* View all branches on terminal.

**_Note_**: Git changed the name of the default branch names from `master` to `main`. If your version of git was installed before that change, your default branch name is possibly `master` instead of `main` after initializing.

You can config the default branch name to main, if you need to:
```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```
